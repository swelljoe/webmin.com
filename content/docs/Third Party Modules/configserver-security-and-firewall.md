### Features
This product was developed to address the complexities and inefficiencies of other tools available for server security:

*   Straight-forward SPI _iptables_ firewall script
*   Daemon process that checks for login authentication failures for:
    *   OpenSSH, Webmin
    *   Dovecot, Postfix, Proftpd
    *   Password protected web pages (_htpasswd_)
    *   _mod\_security_ failures (v1 and v2)
    *   Custom login failures with separate log file and regular expression matching
*   POP3/IMAP login tracking to enforce logins per hour
*   SSH login notification
*   SU login notification
*   Excessive connection blocking
*   Outstanding Webmin UI integration
*   Easy upgrade between versions from within the control panel
*   Easy upgrade between versions from shell
*   Auto-configures the SSH port if it’s non-standard on installation
*   Block traffic on unused server IP addresses – helps reduce the risk to your server
*   Alert when end-user scripts sending excessive emails per hour – for identifying spamming scripts
*   Suspicious process reporting – reports potential exploits running on the server
*   Excessive user processes reporting
*   Excessive user process usage reporting and optional termination
*   Suspicious file reporting – reports potential exploit files in `/tmp` and similar directories
*   Directory and file watching – reports if a watched directory or a file changes
*   Block traffic on a variety of Block Lists including [DShield Block List](http://feeds.dshield.org/block.txt) and [Spamhaus DROP List](http://www.spamhaus.org/drop/index.lasso)
*   BOGON packet protection
*   Pre-configured settings for Low, Medium or High firewall security
*   Works with multiple ethernet devices
*   Server security check – performs a basic security and settings check on the server
*   Allow Dynamic DNS IP addresses – always allow your IP address even if it changes whenever you connect to the internet
*   Alert sent if server load average remains high for a specified length of time
*   _mod\_security_ log reporting (if installed)
*   IDS (Intrusion Detection System) – the last line of detection alerts you to changes to system and application binaries
*   SY flood protection
*   Ping of death protection
*   Port scan tracking and blocking
*   Permanent _and_ temporary (with TTL) IP blocking
*   Exploit checks
*   Account modification tracking – sends alerts if an account entry is modified, e.g. if the password is changed or the login shell
*   Shared _syslog_ aware
*   Messenger service – allows you to redirect connection requests from blocked IP addresses to pre-configured text and HTML pages to inform the visitor that they have been blocked in the firewall. This can be particularly useful for those with a large user base and help process support requests more efficiently
*    Country code blocking – allows you to deny or allow access by ISO Country Code
*    Port flooding detection – per IP, per Port connection flooding detection and mitigation to help block DOS attacks
*   _lfd_ clustering – allows IP address blocks to be automatically propagated around a group of servers running _lfd_. It allows allows cluster-wide allows, removals and configuration changes
*   Quick start _csf_ – deferred startup by _lfd_ for servers with large block and/or allow lists
*   Distributed login failure attack detection
*   Temporary IP allows (with TTL)
*   IPv6 support with _ip6tables_
*   System statistics – basic graphs showing the performance of the server, e.g. Load Averages, CPU Usage, Memory Usage, etc
*   [ipset](http://ipset.netfilter.org/) support for large IP lists
*   Integrated with the CloudFlare firewall

#### ConfigServer firewall (csf)

A comprehensive, straight-forward, and flexible SPI _iptables_ firewall.

#### Login failure daemon (lfd)

A daemon that scans for login attempts against your server that continually fail within a short period of time, effectively blocking brute-force attacks.
