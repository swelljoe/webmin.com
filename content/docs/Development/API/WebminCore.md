### Core Webmin API

#### `web-lib-funcs.pl`
Common functions for Webmin scripts. This file gets in-directly included by all scripts that use `web-lib.pl`.

```perl
use WebminCore;
init_config();
ui_print_header(undef, 'My Module', '');
print 'This is Webmin version ', get_webmin_version(),'<p>\n';
ui_print_footer();
```

##### read_file(file, &hash, [&order], [lowercase], [split-char])
Fill the given hash reference with name=value pairs from a file. The required parameters are:
* `file` - The file to head, which must be text with each line like name=value
* `hash` - The hash reference to add values read from the file to
* `order` - If given, an array reference to add names to in the order they were read
* `lowercase` - If set to 1, names are converted to lower case
* `split-char` - If set, names and values are split on this character instead of =

##### read_file_cached(file, &hash, [&order], [lowercase], [split-char])
Like read_file, but reads from an in-memory cache if the file has already been read in this Webmin script. Recommended, as it behaves exactly the same as read_file, but can be much faster.

##### write_file(file, &hash, [join-char])
Write out the contents of a hash as name=value lines. The parameters are:
* `file` - Full path to write to
* `hash` - A hash reference containing names and values to output
* `join-char` - If given, names and values are separated by this instead of =

##### html_escape(string)
Converts `&`, `<` and `>` codes in text to HTML entities, and returns the new string. This should be used when including data read from other sources in HTML pages.

##### quote_escape(string, [only-quote])
Converts " and ' characters in a string into HTML entities, and returns it. Useful for outputing HTML tag values.

##### tempname([filename])
Returns a mostly random temporary file name, typically under the `/tmp/.webmin` directory. If filename is given, this will be the base name used. Otherwise a unique name is selected randomly.

##### transname([filename])
Behaves exactly like tempname, but records the temp file for deletion when the current Webmin script process exits.

##### trunc(string, maxlen)
Truncates a string to the shortest whole word less than or equal to the given width. Useful for word wrapping.

##### indexof(string, value, ...)
Returns the index of some value in an array of values, or -1 if it was not found.

##### indexoflc(string, value, ...)
Like indexof, but does a case-insensitive match

##### sysprint(handle, [string]+)
Outputs some strings to a file handle, but bypassing IO buffering. Can be used as a replacement for print when writing to pipes or sockets.

##### check_ipaddress(ip)
Check if some IPv4 address is properly formatted, returning 1 if so or 0 if not.

##### check_ip6address(ip)
Check if some IPv6 address is properly formatted, and returns 1 if so.

##### generate_icon(image, title, link, [href], [width], [height], [before-title], [after-title])
Prints HTML for an icon image. The parameters are:
* `image` - URL for the image, like images/foo.gif
* `title` - Text to appear under the icon

* `after-title` - HTML to appear after the title link, but which is not actually in the link

##### urlize
Converts a string to a form ok for putting in a URL, using % escaping.

##### un_urlize(string)

##### include(filename)
Read and output the contents of the given file.

##### copydata(in-handle, out-handle)
Read from one file handle and write to another, until there is no more to read.

##### ReadParseMime([maximum], [&cbfunc, &cbargs])
Read data submitted via a POST request using the multipart/form-data coding, and store it in the global `%in` hash. The optional parameters are:
* `maximum` - If the number of bytes of input exceeds this number, stop reading and call error
* `cbfunc` - A function reference to call after reading each block of data
* `cbargs` - Additional parameters to the callback function

##### ReadParse([&hash], [method], [noplus])
Fills the given hash reference with CGI parameters, or uses the global hash `%in` if none is given. Also sets the global variables `$in` and `@in`. The other parameters are:
* `method` - For use of this HTTP method, such as GET
* `noplus` - Don't convert + in parameters to spaces

##### read_fully(fh, &buffer, length)
Read data from some file handle up to the given length, even in the face of partial reads. Reads the number of bytes read. Stores received data in the string pointed to be the buffer reference.

##### read_parse_mime_callback(size, totalsize, upload-id)
Called by ReadParseMime as new data arrives from a form-data POST. Only updates the file on every 1% change though. For internal use by the upload progress tracker.

##### read_parse_mime_javascript(upload-id, [&fields])
Returns an onSubmit= Javascript statement to popup a window for tracking an upload with the given ID. For internal use by the upload progress tracker.

##### PrintHeader(charset)
Outputs the HTTP headers for an HTML page. The optional charset parameter can be used to set a character set. Normally this function is not called directly, but is rather called by `ui_print_header` or header.

##### header(title, image, [help], [config], [nomodule], [nowebmin], [rightside], [head-stuff], [body-stuff], [below])
Outputs a Webmin HTML page header with a title, including HTTP headers. The parameters are:
* `title` - The text to show at the top of the page

##### get_html_framed_title
Returns the title text for a framed theme main page.

##### get_html_status_line(text-only)
Returns HTML for a script block that sets the status line, or if text-only is set to 1, just return the status line text.

##### popup_header([title], [head-stuff], [body-stuff])
Outputs a page header, suitable for a popup window. If no title is given, absolutely no decorations are output. Also useful in framesets. The parameters are:
* `title` - Title text for the popup window
* `head-stuff` - HTML to appear in the `<head>` section
* `body-stuff` - HTML attributes to be include in the `<body>` tag

##### footer([page, name]+, [noendbody])
Outputs the footer for a Webmin HTML page, possibly with links back to other pages. The links are specified by pairs of parameters, the first of which is a link destination, and the second the link text. For example:
```perl
footer('/', 'Webmin index', '', 'Module menu');
```

##### popup_footer
Outputs html for a footer for a popup window, started by `popup_header`.

##### load_theme_library
Immediately loads the current theme's `theme.pl` file. Not generally useful for most module developers, as this is called automatically by the header function.

##### redirect(url)
Output HTTP headers to redirect the browser to some page. The url parameter is typically a relative URL like `index.cgi` or `list_users.cgi`.

##### kill_byname(name, signal)
Finds a process whose command line contains the given name (such as httpd), and sends some signal to it. The signal can be numeric (like 9) or named (like KILL).

##### kill_byname_logged(name, signal)
Like kill_byname, but also logs the killing.

##### find_byname(name)
Finds processes searching for the given name in their command lines, and returns a list of matching PIDs.

##### error([message]+)
Display an error message and exit. This should be used by CGI scripts that encounter a fatal error or invalid user input to notify users of the problem. If `error_setup` has been called, the displayed error message will be prefixed by the message setup using that function.

##### popup_error([message]+)
This function is almost identical to error, but displays the message with HTML headers suitable for a popup window.

##### error_setup(message)
Registers a message to be prepended to all error messages displayed by the error function.

##### wait_for(handle, regexp, regexp, ...)
Reads from the input stream until one of the regexps matches, and returns the index of the matching regexp, or -1 if input ended before any matched. This is very useful for parsing the output of interactive programs, and can be used with a two-way pipe to feed input to a program in response to output matched by this function.

If the matching regexp contains bracketed sub-expressions, their values will be placed in the global array @matches, indexed starting from 1. You cannot use the Perl variables `$1`, `$2` and so on to capture matches.

Example code:
```perl
my $rv = wait_for($loginfh, "username:");
if ($rv -1) {
    error("Didn't get username prompt");
}
print $loginfh "joe\n";
my $rv = wait_for($loginfh, "password:");
if ($rv -1) {
    error("Didn't get password prompt");
}
print $loginfh "smeg\n";
```

##### fast_wait_for(handle, string, string, ...)
This function behaves very similar to wait_for (documented above), but instead of taking regular expressions as parameters, it takes strings. As soon as the input contains one of them, it will return the index of the matching string. If the input ends before any match, it returns -1.

##### has_command(command)
Returns the full path to the executable if some command is in the path, or undef if not found. If the given command is already an absolute path and exists, then the same path will be returned.

##### make_date(seconds, [date-only], [fmt])
Converts a Unix date/time in seconds to a human-readable form, by default formatted like dd/mmm/yyyy hh:mm:ss. Parameters are:
* `seconds` - Unix time is seconds to convert
* `date-only` - If set to 1, exclude the time from the returned string
* `fmt` - Optional, one of dd/mon/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy or yyyy/mm/dd

##### file_chooser_button(input, type, [form], [chroot], [addmode])
Return HTML for a button that pops up a file chooser when clicked, and places the selected filename into another HTML field. The parameters are:
* `input` - Name of the form field to store the filename in
* `type` - 0 for file or directory chooser, or 1 for directory only
* `form` - Index of the form containing the button
* `chroot` - If set to 1, the chooser will be limited to this directory
* `addmode` - If set to 1, the selected filename will be appended to the text box instead of replacing it's contents

##### popup_window_button(url, width, height, scrollbars?, &field-mappings)
Returns HTML for a button that will popup a chooser window of some kind. The parameters are:
* `url` - Base URL of the popup window's contents
* `width` - Width of the window in pixels
* `height` - Height in pixels
* `scrollbars` - Set to 1 if the window should have scrollbars. The field-mappings parameter is an array ref of array refs containing
** `Attribute` to assign field to in the popup window
** `Form` field name
** `CGI` parameter to URL for value, if any

##### read_acl(&user-module-hash, &user-list-hash)
Reads the Webmin acl file into the given hash references. The first is indexed by a combined key of username,module , with the value being set to 1 when the user has access to that module. The second is indexed by username, with the value being an array ref of allowed modules.

This function is deprecated in favour of foreign_available, which performs a more comprehensive check of module availability.

##### acl_filename
Returns the file containing the webmin ACL, which is usually `/etc/webmin/webmin.acl`.

##### acl_check
Does nothing, but kept around for compatability.

##### get_miniserv_config(&hash)
Reads the Webmin webserver's (`miniserv.pl`) configuration file, usually located at `/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf`, and stores its names and values in the given hash reference.

##### put_miniserv_config(&hash)
Writes out the Webmin webserver configuration file from the contents of the given hash ref. This should be initially populated by get_miniserv_config, like so:

```perl
get_miniserv_config(\%miniserv);
$miniserv{'port'} = 10005;
put_miniserv_config(\%miniserv);
restart_miniserv();
```

##### restart_miniserv([nowait])
Kill the old miniserv process and re-start it, then optionally waits for it to restart. This will apply all configuration settings.

##### reload_miniserv
Sends a USR1 signal to the miniserv process, telling it to read-read it's configuration files. Not all changes will be applied though, such as the IP addresses and ports to accept connections on.

* `api-only` - Set to 1 if you just want to check if the module provides an API that others can call, instead of the full web UI

##### foreign_exists(module)
Checks if some other module exists. The module parameter is the short module name.

##### foreign_available(module)
Returns 1 if some module is installed, and acessible to the current user. The module parameter is the module directory name.

##### foreign_require(module, [file], [package])
Brings in functions from another module, and places them in the Perl namespace with the same name as the module. The parameters are:
* `module` - The source module's directory name, like sendmail
* `file` - The API file in that module, like `sendmail-lib.pl`. If missing, all API files are loaded
* `package` - Perl package to place the module's functions and global variables in
If the original module name contains dashes, they will be replaced with _ in the package name.

##### foreign_call(module, function, [arg]*)
Call a function in another module. The module parameter is the target module directory name, function is the perl sub to call, and the remaining parameters are the arguments. However, unless you need to call a function whose name is dynamic, it is better to use Perl's cross-module function call syntax like `module::function(args)`.

##### foreign_config(module, [user-config])
Get the configuration from another module, and return it as a hash. If the user-config parameter is set to 1, returns the Usermin user-level preferences for the current user instead.

##### foreign_installed(module, mode)
Checks if the server for some module is installed, and possibly also checks if the module has been configured by Webmin. For mode 1, returns 2 if the server is installed and configured for use by Webmin, 1 if installed but not configured, or 0 otherwise. For mode 0, returns 1 if installed, 0 if not. If the module does not provide an `install_check.pl` script, assumes that the server is installed.

##### foreign_defined(module, function)
Returns 1 if some function is defined in another module. In general, it is simpler to use the syntax `&defined(module::function)` instead.

##### get_system_hostname([short])
Returns the hostname of this system. If the short parameter is set to 1, then the domain name is not prepended - otherwise, Webmin will attempt to get the fully qualified hostname, like `foo.example.com`.

##### get_webmin_version
Returns the version of Webmin currently being run, such as 1.450.

##### get_module_acl([user], [module], [no-rbac], [no-default])
Returns a hash containing access control options for the given user and module. By default the current username and module name are used. If the no-rbac flag is given, the permissions will not be updated based on the user's RBAC role (as seen on Solaris). If the no-default flag is given, default permissions for the module will not be included.

##### get_group_module_acl(group, [module])
Returns the ACL for a Webmin group, in an optional module (which defaults to the current module).

##### save_module_acl(&acl, [user], [module])
Updates the acl hash for some user and module. The parameters are:
* `acl` - Hash reference for the new access control options
* `user` - User to update, defaulting to the current user
* `module` - Module to update, defaulting to the caller

##### save_group_module_acl(&acl, group, [module])
Updates the acl hash for some group and module. The parameters are:
* `acl` - Hash reference for the new access control options
* `group` - Group name to update
* `module` - Module to update, defaulting to the caller

##### init_config
This function must be called by all Webmin CGI scripts, either directly or indirectly via a per-module `lib.pl` file. It performs a number of initialization and housekeeping tasks, such as working out the module name, checking that the current user has access to the module, and populating global variables. Some of the variables set include:
* `$config_directory` - Base Webmin config directory, typically `/etc/webmin`
* `$var_directory` - Base logs directory, typically `/var/webmin`
* `%config` - Per-module configuration
* `%gconfig` - Global configuration
* `$scriptname` - Base name of the current perl script
* `$module_name` - The name of the current module
* `$module_config_directory` - The config directory for this module
* `$module_config_file` - The config file for this module
* `$module_root_directory` - This module's code directory
* `$webmin_logfile` - The detailed logfile for webmin
* `$remote_user` - The actual username used to login to webmin
* `$base_remote_user` - The username whose permissions are in effect
* `$current_theme` - The theme currently in use
* `$root_directory` - The first root directory of this webmin install
* `@root_directories` - All root directories for this webmin install

##### load_language([module], [directory])
Returns a hashtable mapping text codes to strings in the appropriate language, based on the `$current_lang` global variable, which is in turn set based on the Webmin user's selection. The optional module parameter tells the function which module to load strings for, and defaults to the calling module. The optional directory parameter can be used to load strings from a directory other than lang.

In regular module development you will never need to call this function directly, as init_config calls it for you, and places the module's strings into the %text hash.

##### text_subs(string)
Used internally by load_language to expand `$code` substitutions in language files.

##### text(message, [substitute]+)
Returns a translated message from %text, but with `$1`, `$2`, etc.. replaced with the substitute parameters. This makes it easy to use strings with placeholders that get replaced with programmatically generated text. For example:
```perl
print &text('index_hello', $remote_user),"<p>\n";
```

##### encode_base64(string)
Encodes a string into base64 format, for use in MIME email or HTTP authorization headers.

##### decode_base64(string)
Converts a base64-encoded string into plain text. The opposite of encode_base64.

##### get_module_info(module, [noclone], [forcache])
Returns a hash containg details of the given module. Some useful keys are:
* `dir` - The module directory, like sendmail
* `desc` - Human-readable description, in the current users" language
* `version` - Optional module version number
* `os_support` - List of supported operating systems and versions
* `category` - Category on Webmin's left menu, like net
* `sortable` - If set to 1, tables in this module are sortable

##### get_all_module_infos(cachemode)
Returns a list contains the information on all modules in this webmin install, including clones. Uses caching to reduce the number of module.info files that need to be read. Each element of the array is a hash reference in the same format as returned by get_module_info. The cache mode flag can be: 0 = read and write, 1 = don"t read or write, 2 = read only

##### get_theme_info(theme)
Returns a hash containing a theme's details, taken from it's theme.info file. Some useful keys are:
* `dir` - The theme directory, like blue-theme
* `desc` - Human-readable description, in the current users' language
* `version` - Optional module version number
* `os_support` - List of supported operating systems and versions

##### list_languages
Returns an array of supported languages, taken from Webmin's os_list.txt file. Each is a hash reference with the following keys:
* `lang` - The short language code, like es for Spanish
* `desc` - A human-readable description, in English
* `charset` - An optional character set to use when displaying the language
* `titles` - Set to 1 only if Webmin has title images for the language
* `fallback` - The code for another language to use if a string does not exist in this one. For all languages, English is the ultimate fallback

##### read_env_file(file, &hash)
Similar to Webmin's read_file() function, but handles files containing shell environment variables formatted like:
```bash
export FOO=bar
SMEG="spod"
```
The file parameter is the full path to the file to read, and hash a Perl hash ref to read names and values into.

##### write_env_file(file, &hash, [export])
Writes out a hash to a file in name="value" format, suitable for use in a shell script. The parameters are:
* `file` - Full path for a file to write to
* `hash` - Hash reference of names and values to write
* `export` - If set to 1, preceed each variable setting with the word "export"

##### lock_file(filename, [readonly], [forcefile])
Lock a file for exclusive access. If the file is already locked, spin until it is freed. Uses a .lock file, which is not 100% reliable, but seems to work OK. The parameters are:
* `filename` - File or directory to lock
* `readonly` - If set, the lock is for reading the file only. More than one script can have a readonly lock, but only one can hold a write lock
* `forcefile` - Force the file to be considered as a real file and not a symlink for Webmin actions logging purposes

##### unlock_file(filename)
Release a lock on a file taken out by lock_file. If Webmin actions logging of file changes is enabled, then at unlock file a diff will be taken between the old and new contents, and stored under `/var/webmin/diffs` when `webmin_log` is called. This can then be viewed in the Webmin Actions Log module.

##### test_lock(file)
Returns 1 if some file is currently locked, 0 if not.

##### unlock_all_files
Unlocks all files locked by the current script.

##### can_lock_file(file)
Returns 1 if some file should be locked, based on the settings in the Webmin Configuration module. For internal use by lock_file only.

##### webmin_log(action, type, object, &params, [module], [host, script-on-host, client-ip])
Log some action taken by a user. This is typically called at the end of a script, once all file changes are complete and all commands run. The parameters are:
* `action` - A short code for the action being performed, like "create"
* `type` - A code for the type of object the action is performed to, like "user"
* `object` - A short name for the object, like "joe" if the Unix user "joe" was just created
* `params` - A hash ref of additional information about the action
* `module` - Name of the module in which the action was performed, which defaults to the current module
* `host` - Remote host on which the action was performed. You should never need to set this (or the following two parameters), as they are used only for remote Webmin logging
* `script-on-host` - Script name like `create_user.cgi` on the host the action was performed on
* `client-ip` - IP address of the browser that performed the action

##### additional_log(type, object, data, [input])
Records additional log data for an upcoming call to webmin_log, such as a command that was run or SQL that was executed. Typically you will never need to call this function directory.

##### webmin_debug_log(type, message)
Write something to the Webmin debug log. For internal use only.

##### system_logged(command)
Just calls the Perl system() function, but also logs the command run.

##### backquote_logged(command)
Executes a command and returns the output (like `command`), but also logs it.

##### backquote_with_timeout(command, timeout, safe?, [maxlines])
Runs some command, waiting at most the given number of seconds for it to complete, and returns the output. The maxlines parameter sets the number of lines of output to capture. The safe parameter should be set to 1 if the command is safe for read-only mode users to run.

##### backquote_command(command, safe?)
Executes a command and returns the output (like `command`), subject to command translation. The safe parameter should be set to 1 if the command is safe for read-only mode users to run.

##### kill_logged(signal, pid, ...)
Like Perl's built-in kill function, but also logs the fact that some process was killed. On Windows, falls back to calling process.exe to terminate a process.

##### rename_logged(old, new)
Re-names a file and logs the rename. If the old and new files are on different filesystems, calls mv or the Windows rename function to do the job.

##### rename_file(old, new)
Renames a file or directory. If the old and new files are on different filesystems, calls mv or the Windows rename function to do the job.

##### symlink_logged(src, dest)
Create a symlink, and logs it. Effectively does the same thing as the Perl symlink function.

##### symlink_file(src, dest)
Creates a soft link, unless in read-only mode. Effectively does the same thing as the Perl symlink function.

##### link_file(src, dest)
Creates a hard link, unless in read-only mode. The existing new link file will be deleted if necessary. Effectively the same as Perl's link function.

##### make_dir(dir, perms, recursive)
Creates a directory and sets permissions on it, unless in read-only mode. The perms parameter sets the octal permissions to apply, which unlike Perl's mkdir will really get set. The recursive flag can be set to 1 to have the function create parent directories too.

##### set_ownership_permissions(user, group, perms, file, ...)
Sets the user, group owner and permissions on some files. The parameters are:
* `user` - UID or username to change the file owner to. If undef, then the owner is not changed
* `group` - GID or group name to change the file group to. If undef, then the group is set to the user's primary group
* `perms` - Octal permissions set to set on the file. If undef, they are left alone
* `file` - One or more files or directories to modify

##### unlink_logged(file, ...)
Like Perl's unlink function, but locks the files beforehand and un-locks them after so that the deletion is logged by Webmin.

##### unlink_file(file, ...)
Deletes some files or directories. Like Perl's unlink function, but also recursively deletes directories with the rm command if needed.

##### copy_source_dest(source, dest)
Copy some file or directory to a new location. Returns 1 on success, or 0 on failure - also sets `$!` on failure. If the source is a directory, uses piped tar commands to copy a whole directory structure including permissions and special files.

##### remote_session_name( host|&server )
Generates a session ID for some server. For this server, this will always be an empty string. For a server object it will include the hostname and port and PID. For a server name, it will include the hostname and PID. For internal use only.

##### remote_foreign_require(server, module, file)
Connects to `rpc.cgi` on a remote webmin server and have it open a session to a process that will actually do the require and run functions. This is the equivalent for foreign_require, but for a remote Webmin system. The server parameter can either be a hostname of a system registered in the Webmin Servers Index module, or a hash reference for a system from that module.

##### remote_foreign_call(server, module, function, [arg]*)
Call a function on a remote server. Must have been setup first with remote_foreign_require for the same server and module. Equivalent to foreign_call, but with the extra server parameter to specify the remote system's hostname.

##### remote_foreign_check(server, module, [api-only])
Checks if some module is installed and supported on a remote server. Equivilant to foreign_check, but for the remote Webmin system specified by the server parameter.

##### remote_foreign_config(server, module)
Gets the configuration for some module from a remote server, as a hash. Equivalent to foreign_config, but for a remote system.

##### remote_eval(server, module, code)
Evaluates some perl code in the context of a module on a remote webmin server. The server parameter must be the hostname of a remote system, module must be a module directory name, and code a string of Perl code to run. This can only be called after remote_foreign_require for the same server and module.

##### remote_write(server, localfile, [remotefile], [remotebasename])
Transfers some local file to another server via Webmin's RPC protocol, and returns the resulting remote filename. If the remotefile parameter is given, that is the destination filename which will be used. Otherwise a randomly selected temporary filename will be used, and returned by the function.

##### remote_read(server, localfile, remotefile)
Transfers a file from a remote server to this system, using Webmin's RPC protocol. The server parameter must be the hostname of a system registered in the Webmin Servers Index module, localfile is the destination path on this system, and remotefile is the file to fetch from the remote server.

##### remote_finished
Close all remote sessions. This happens automatically after a while anyway, but this function should be called to clean things up faster.

##### remote_error_setup(&function)
Sets a function to be called instead of `&error` when a remote RPC operation fails. Useful if you want to have more control over your remote operations.

##### remote_rpc_call(server, structure)
Calls `rpc.cgi` on some server and passes it a perl structure (hash,array,etc) and then reads back a reply structure. This is mainly for internal use only, and is called by the other remote_* `functions.

#####` remote_multi_callback(&servers, parallel, &function, arg||&args, &returns, &errors, [module, library])
Executes some function in parallel on multiple servers at once. Fills in the returns and errors arrays respectively. If the module and library parameters are given, that module is remotely required on the server first, to check if it is connectable. The parameters are:

##### disk_usage_kb(directory)
Returns the number of kB used by some directory and all subdirs. Implemented by calling the =du -k= command.

##### recursive_disk_usage(directory)
Returns the number of bytes taken up by all files in some directory and all sub-directories, by summing up their lengths. The disk_usage_kb is more reflective of reality, as the filesystem typically pads file sizes to 1k or 4k blocks.

##### help_search_link(term, [ section, ... ] )
Returns HTML for a link to the man module for searching local and online docs for various search terms. The term parameter can either be a single word like "bind", or a space-separated list of words. This function is typically used by modules that want to refer users to additional documentation in man pages or local system doc files.

##### make_http_connection(host, port, ssl, method, page, [&headers])

##### close_http_connection(&handle)
Closes a connection to an HTTP server, identified by the given handle.

##### clean_environment
Deletes any environment variables inherited from miniserv so that they won"t be passed to programs started by webmin. This is useful when calling programs that check for CGI-related environment variables and modify their behaviour, and to avoid passing sensitive variables to un-trusted programs.

##### reset_environment
Puts the environment back how it was before clean_environment was callled.

##### progress_callback
Never called directly, but useful for passing to &http_download to print out progress of an HTTP request.

##### switch_to_remote_user

Returns a list of modules available to the current user, based on operating system support, access control and usermod restrictions. Useful in themes that need to display a list of modules the user can use. Each element of the returned array is a hash reference in the same format as returned by get_module_info.

##### get_visible_module_infos(nocache)
Like get_available_module_infos, but excludes hidden modules from the list. Each element of the returned array is a hash reference in the same format as returned by get_module_info.

##### get_visible_modules_categories(nocache)
Returns a list of Webmin module categories, each of which is a hash ref with "code", "desc" and "modules" keys. The modules value is an array ref of modules in the category, in the format returned by get_module_info. Un-used modules are automatically assigned to the "unused" category, and those with no category are put into "others".

##### is_under_directory(directory, file)
Returns 1 if the given file is under the specified directory, 0 if not. Symlinks are taken into account in the file to find it's "real" location.

##### parse_http_url(url, [basehost, baseport, basepage, basessl])
Given an absolute URL, returns the host, port, page and ssl flag components. Relative URLs can also be parsed, if the base information is provided.

##### check_clicks_function

##### load_entities_map
Returns a hash ref containing mappings between HTML entities (like ouml) and ascii values (like 246). Mainly for internal use.

##### entities_to_ascii(string)
Given a string containing HTML entities like &ouml; and &#55;, replace them with their ASCII equivalents.

##### save_module_config([&config], [modulename])
Saves the configuration for some module. The config parameter is an optional hash reference of names and values to save, which defaults to the global %config hash. The modulename parameter is the module to update the config file, which defaults to the current module.

##### save_user_module_config([&config], [modulename])
Saves the user's Usermin preferences for some module. The config parameter is an optional hash reference of names and values to save, which defaults to the global %userconfig hash. The modulename parameter is the module to update the config file, which defaults to the current module.

##### nice_size(bytes, [min])
Converts a number of bytes into a number followed by a suffix like GB, MB or kB. Rounding is to two decimal digits. The optional min parameter sets the smallest units to use - so you could pass 1024*1024 to never show bytes or kB.

* `handle` - File handle to open, as you would use in Perl's open function
* `file` - Full path to the file to write, prefixed by `>` or `>>` to indicate over-writing or appending. In append mode, no temp file is used
* `no-error` - By default, this function will call error if the open fails. Setting this parameter to 1 causes it to return 0 on failure, and set `$!` with the error code
* `no-tempfile` - If set to 1, writing will be direct to the file instead of using a temporary file
* `safe` - Indicates to users in read-only mode that this write is safe and non-destructive

##### close_tempfile(file||handle)
Copies a temp file to the actual file, assuming that all writes were successful. The handle must have been one passed to open_tempfile.

##### month_to_number(month)
Converts a month name like feb to a number like 1.

##### number_to_month(number)
Converts a number like 1 to a month name like Feb.
