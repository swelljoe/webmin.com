The partial module translations made by humans are covered by automated language manager script.

All translated modules have a main language file without extension, i.e. `de` and automatically translated variant, i.e. `de.auto`. Volunteers willing to contribute to the translations, should take automatically translated strings from `.auto` language file (located in `lang/` or in `ulang/` directory of each module), review, edit and move them to the main language file.

Each `.auto` file is correctly formatted, and only the language may need adjustments. It's important to maintain the exact formatting of the language strings, including the presence or absence of dots at the beginning or end of strings, as well as other formatting details.

All language files must use `utf-8` encoding. The following languages are supported by the current Webmin version:
